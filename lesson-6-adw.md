## Aider has a Secret

The core topic and principle of this lesson: 

A.D.W - AI Develop Workflow

This technique is so impactful. It must also be the principal.

To scale your AI coding capabilities even further you can use AI developer workflows to automate away entire classes of engineering tasks. AI Developer workflows hinge on a signle requarement. As long as there is a pattern you can use ADWs to solve  to solve the problem once and for all. After this lesson you will have skill to stop doing repetitive pattern-based engineering work. No more migration files, no more mindless api creation, no more templating, no more scaffolding, no more mindless testing the same thing in the same format over  and over. in this lesson we automate mindless engineering work. In this lesson you'll learn how to build a reusable AI coding assistant built to solve one problem class extremely well. 

 1 st Principal - KISS

 Aiders secret that you can AI code programmatically to automate entire classes of engineering work. Application of this is absolutely insanely massive. This means you can run aider like you would run any programm. You can pass state and solve an entire set of engineering problems in a single command.  

 We just automated small task and we never have to do this again. This is the beginning of the edge.  

 You can now using an AI coding assitants like aider things like everything working through, everything been learning throughout this course you know the capabilities to write re-usable AI coding assistants build to solve specific problems extremely well. 

  ADW is a small  piece of code that wraps AI coding assistant that can take in parametrs. it's a reusable ai coding assistant built to solve one problem extraordinary well. 

  Now you have abilities to solve any class of engineering problems across your codebases in a reusable fashion. As long as your pattern you can deploy ADWs. 

  The only true limitation here the only true limitation now is your imagination, your abilities to hit the three big bullseye and the surrounding code that you have setup  your codebase, right? 

  of course, over time your codebases change,you might want make tweaks to your ai developer workflow. THat's fine, you can that's completely accessable here. you can commit this code to your repository, you can do anything you want with this code. it is just code. but this is a code is different. this code works for you. this code operates you, this code writes code for you. it solves problems for you. This is a ai developer workflow. This is advanced ai coding. 

  NOw you have a technique, to help you scale your ai coding even further. Now you can write re-usable ai coding assitants that solve a specific set of problems very well. 

  Using aider we can run everything in architect mode. For this simpler spec prompt with only two steps, we don't need powerfull reasoning model to solve this problem. But it does help to use architect mode to increase accuracy just a little bit and improve the performance of the ai developer workflow. 

  About creating different types of charts:

  This is something that I can just think and hand off to ai assistant workflow. Right? Why? because we solved the problem type completely. That is, the class of problem is solved.  

  As you can see, as we build out our ai coding skills, we're turning into commander of compute , commander of ai coding assistants , and the role is turning into less type less lines of code, more review, more think , more plan. we turning into  engineer manager, product manager, a higher livel engineer that can do massively more than we could before while maintaining control of product. we are getting into best of the world.  a lot of time we as engineer you too buggled  to low-level details. we now handing that off be superfactive into be larger vision of product, users, so on and so forth. Now we can do both. We can think about product, we can think high level and than we can go and pass off that low-level work to our sweet ai coding assistants, to our sweet re-usable ai coding assistants via this ai developer workflow pattern.
