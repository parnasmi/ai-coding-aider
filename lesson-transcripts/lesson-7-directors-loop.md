## Let the Code Write Itself

 Director Pattern, also known as Director loop. This is an agentic workflow, where you define a context, prompt and model  as usual and then you define execution  command and a eveluator. These are 2 missings pieces,  you need to close the loop. Your execution command runs after your ai coding assistant generated code and then your eveluator takes the output of your execution command and determines if the task is done. if your task is not completed, it creates feedbac and loops back to your ai coding assistant, closing the loop. An eveluator can be a piece of code, but we are going to focus on eveluators that are themselves llms calls. this is a pattern from language model testing, you may heard 'llm as judge'. Or you have a llm grade output of another llm. We this pattern we close the loop. Because now you can write a prompt, have your ai coding assistant generate code , execute the code, eveluate the code and if the eveluation fails, pass the feedback back to  ai coding assistant. This pattern is the prototype to the future of the ai to the future let the code write itself. By building upon patterns we established and the ai developer workflow of spec prompt , in this lesson, we close the loop by giving our  ai coding assistant feedback through an eveluator function. With this pattern, even its early form, we are approaching edge of ai coding. ANd potentially edge of software engineering as we know it. This pattern enables ai coding tools to act in a more autonomous way. solving your problems iteratively until it's complete. Next generation ai coding tools like deven and github's copilot workspace rely on patterns,like director pattern run autonomously. 

 We have agentic ai coding workflow that runs code based on great plan that we have been building up on the  knowledge skills  to know how to build and then we're handing off the coding process to out director pattern, to our ai coding assistant tool. We are small ai agent team here. 

 We are becoming curators of code, We are becoming curators of workflows, We are becoming lead engineers, engineer managers we are moving ourselves up the stack and we hading off the low-level codes, details, the how we are handing that all of that ai coding assistants.
