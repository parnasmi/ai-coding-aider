## Aider’s Secret: AI Developer Workflows (ADWs)

### The Core Principle: A.D.W.

The core topic of this lesson is the **AI Developer Workflow (ADW)**. This technique is so impactful that it should be considered a fundamental principle of modern engineering.

To scale your AI coding capabilities, you can use ADWs to automate away entire classes of engineering tasks. These workflows hinge on a single requirement: **the existence of a pattern.** As long as there is a pattern, you can use an ADW to solve the problem once and for all.

By the end of this lesson, you will have the skill to stop doing repetitive, pattern-based engineering work. No more manual migration files, no more mindless API creation, no more templating, no more scaffolding, and no more repetitive testing. We are here to automate the "mindless" work by building reusable AI coding assistants designed to solve specific problem classes extremely well.

### 1st Principle: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Aider’s "secret" is that you can use it programmatically to automate engineering work at scale. The application of this is massive: you can run Aider just like any other program. You can pass state to it and solve an entire set of engineering problems with a single command.

Once you automate a small, repetitive task, you never have to do it manually again. This is the beginning of the "edge" in software engineering.

### What is an ADW?

An **AI Developer Workflow** is a small piece of code that wraps an AI coding assistant (like Aider) and allows it to take in parameters. It is a reusable tool built to solve one specific class of problems extraordinarily well.

With this, you gain the ability to solve any class of engineering problems across your codebases in a reusable fashion. The only true limitation now is your imagination, your ability to define the "Big Three" (Context, Model, Prompt), and the quality of the surrounding code in your codebase.

### Code That Works For You

Over time, as your codebase evolves, you may need to tweak your AI Developer Workflow. That is perfectly fine—this workflow is just code. You can commit it to your repository and maintain it like any other asset. However, this code is different: **this code works for you.** It operates on your behalf and writes other code for you. This is advanced AI coding.

### Practical Application: Architect Mode and Task Handoff

When using Aider, we can run everything in **Architect Mode**. For simpler spec prompts with only a few steps, a powerful reasoning model might not be strictly necessary, but Architect Mode increases accuracy and improves the overall performance of the workflow.

Consider the task of creating different types of charts (radial, bubble, etc.):
This is a task I can simply think through and hand off to an AI workflow. Why? Because we have solved the **problem type** completely. The entire class of the problem is now handled.

### The New Role of the Engineer

As we build these skills, we are transforming into **Commanders of Compute**. Our role is shifting:

* **Less** typing and fewer lines of manual code.
* **More** reviewing, thinking, and planning.

We are becoming a hybrid of an Engineering Manager, a Product Manager, and a High-Level Architect. We can achieve massively more than before while maintaining total control over the product. Often, engineers get bogged down in low-level details; now, we hand those off. This allows us to focus on the larger vision, the users, and the product, while our "sweet" reusable AI assistants handle the execution.

### The Future: Asymmetric Engineering

Over the next few years, some engineers may struggle or transition out of the industry because they cannot adapt to these ideas. Those who cannot transition from the "how" to the "what" will be left behind. By understanding this technique, you gain access to **asymmetric engineering**—the ability to produce results that are vastly disproportionate to the time you spend.
