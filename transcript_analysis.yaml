  The Orchestrator Pattern involves overseeing AI agents across multiple tasks
  in software development, shifting from manual coding to directing intelligent
  agents. This approach allows for simultaneous feature development and
  maintenance tasks, with human focus on more complex, creative problems. The
  model uses AI agents for routine tasks like dependency upgrades and security
  patches, monitored through a hardened CI/CD pipeline. The integration of voice
  commands makes task delegation fast and efficient, with humans making critical
  decisions and reviews.
bullet_point_highlights:
  - Focus on orchestrating AI and human agents in software development.
  - Voice-driven workflows enhance efficiency and task delegation.
  - AI agents handle routine maintenance tasks in isolated environments.
  - Humans focus on creative and judgment-intensive tasks.
  - CI/CD pipeline ensures safety and reliability of AI contributions.
  - Clear task briefs facilitate AI agent task execution and success.
