    ## Quick Summary
    The Orchestrator Pattern involves overseeing AI agents and human efforts to efficiently execute a product vision, by delegating well-defined tasks to AI while focusing human attention on creative problem-solving and decision-making. This approach leverages voice input and AI agents to restructure software development, maximizing efficiency and maintaining high safety standards.

    ## Bullet Point Highlights
    - The shift from developer to orchestrator: overseeing AI and human agents.
- AI agents handle maintenance tasks, allowing humans to focus on creative development.
- Voice input reduces task initiation friction, enhancing productivity.
- Critical role of CI/CD pipeline to maintain safety and efficiency.
- The orchestrator's primary workstation integrates agentic coding platforms and local development environments.
- Voice technology like WisprFlow enables efficient task dispatching.
- Orchestrator Pattern allows simultaneous work on different contexts.
- Differentiating between tasks suitable for AI agents and those requiring human involvement.
- Agents operate in isolated environments and provide outputs through PRs for human review.
- Humans maintain control over product direction, review, and exception handling.
