# Transcript Analytics v0 Specification

## High-Level Objective

- Create a CLI transcript analytics application

## Mid-Level Objective

- Build a python MVP typer CLI application.
- Accept a path to a text file.
- Count the frequency of each word in a file, filter out common words, and limit by count threshold.
- Use an openai chat completion with structured output analyze the transcript and word counts.
- Rich print the frequency of each word to the terminal and the transcript analysis.

## Implementation Notes
- No need to import any external libraries see pyproject.toml for dependencies.
- Comment every function.
- For typer commands add usage examples starting with uv run main ‹func name dash sep and params>
- When code block is given in low-level tasks, use it without making changes (Task 4).
- Carefully review each low-level task for exact code changes.

## Context

### Beginning context

- `src/spec_based__ai_coding/main.py`
- `pyproject.toml` (readonly) 


### Ending context

- `src/spec_based_ai_coding/main-py`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `src/spec_based_ai_coding/llm.py` (new file)
- `src/spec_based_ai_coding/word_counter.py` (new file)
- `src/spec_based_ai_coding/data_types-py` (new file)
- `src/spec_based_ai_coding/constants.py` (new file)


## Low-Level Tasks
> Ordered from start to finish

1. Create common word blacklist.
```aider
CREATE src/spec_based_ai_coding/constants.py:
    CREATE COMMON_WORDS_BLACKLIST = ['the', 'and', ...add 50 more common words]
```

2. Create our data types.
```aider
CREATE src/spec_based_ai_coding/data_types.py:
    CREATE pydantic types:
        WordCounts (BaseModel): {count_to_word_map: Dict[str, int]},
        TranscriptAnalysis (BaseModel): {
            quick_summary: str
            bullet_point_highlights: List[str] 
            sentiment_analysis: str
            keywords: List[str]
        }
```
3. Create our word counter & filter out & limit by count threshold.
```aider
CREATE src/spec_based_ai_coding/word_counter.py:
CREATE word_counter(script: str, min_count_threshold: int = 10) → WordCounts:
    Remove punctuation from script and make all words lowercase, 
    Use the COMMON_WORDS_BLACKLIST to filter out common words,
    Only include words that are greater than the min_count_threshold.
    Sort descending by count
```

4. Create our LLM function using the code block below.
```python
# CREATE src/spec_based_ai_coding/Lm.py: Use code block below no changes.


5. Update our main function to use new count and analysis functions.
